# online-survay-system
An online survey system is a software application designed to create, distribute, collect, and analyze surveys or questionnaires over the internet. These systems are widely used in various fields such as market research, academic research, customer feedback, employee satisfaction assessment, and more. 

1. To create an Online Survey System in Java, you can follow these steps:
1. Setup Project Structure:
• Create a new Java project in your preferred IDE.
• Organize your project into packages for better structure (e.g., ui, model, database,
util).

3. Design User Interface:
• Use Java Swing or JavaFX to design the graphical user interface (GUI).
• Create frames, panels, buttons, text fields, and other components as needed for survey
creation, response collection, and report generation.

5. Define Data Model:
• Create Java classes to represent the core entities of the survey system, such as Survey,
Question, Response, and User.
• Define appropriate properties and methods for each class to capture relevant data and
behavior.

7. Database Management:
• Choose a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL or SQLite.
• Create a database schema to store survey data, user information, and responses.
• Implement database connectivity using JDBC to interact with the database from Java
code.

9. Implement Survey Creation:
• Design forms or dialogs for users to create surveys.
• Allow users to add various types of questions (e.g., multiple choice, text input) to the
survey.
• Implement logic to store survey data in the database upon creation.

10. Implement Survey Distribution:
• Create mechanisms to distribute surveys to respondents via email or a web interface.
• Generate unique survey links for each respondent to track responses.
• Store survey distribution data in the database.

12. Implement Response Collection:
• Design interfaces for respondents to complete surveys online.
• Validate and store responses in the database upon submission.
• Handle error cases, such as duplicate responses or incomplete surveys.

14. Implement Report Generation:
• Analyze survey responses to generate insightful reports.
• Use libraries like Apache POI or iText to create PDF or Excel reports.
• Display graphical representations of survey data using charting libraries like JFreeChart
or Apache Commons Chart.

16. Implement User Authentication and Authorization:
• Create login screens for users to authenticate themselves.
• Implement authorization mechanisms to control access to survey creation, response
collection, and report generation functionalities based on user roles and permissions.
